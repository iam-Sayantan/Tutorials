XSLT: Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations.

It is a collection of two technologies, namely XSL and XPATH. 

XSL stands for Extensible Stylesheet Language 
and 
XPATH as the name itself says,
It shows us the path or it tells when to do a particular transformation or 
when to apply a particular transformation.

So XSL tells what to do and XPATH tells when to do that. 
And the XSLT processor is the one which does the transformations for us.

So if we have one kind of XML document and if we want to transform it into either a different type of
XML document or into HTML,we will pass it along to a XSLT processor.
We will feed that XSLT processor with the XSL stylesheet (also a XML document) that we will be developing.


let's say we are developing a shopping application. 
And this shopping application use XML, Order.xml which has an ORDERID in it.

Now let's say we have to integrate with a third party application to
ship all the products that our customers buy on our shopping portal.We have to send the entire order or atleast
the shipping information as XML to this shipping app.And if this shipping application is expecting an ID. 
Instead of ORDERID in the XML, it simply expects an ID. XSLT comes into picture.

Similarly, the news portal can transform the XML that is stored in a document repository 
to HTML which is very powerful.
