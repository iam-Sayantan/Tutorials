 Simple schema another way to validate you attack 
 some other file is by using data type definition or DTD.
 
 
<!ELEMENT email (to,subject,body)>  - email is the root element; 'to','subject','body' are the child elements
<!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> - The element 'to' needs content

#PCDATA means parseable character data.

The elements index similar document should occur in the exact order that we specify right in the dtd file.

<!ELEMENT email (to | (subject,body))> - 
This means the XML can either contain the 'to' 
element or the '(subject,body)' elements
but not all three at the same time.

Occurrence Indicators
The indicators will tell about the occurrences of the elements.

+ allows an element to appear one or more times within a parent element 
* allows the element to appear zero or more types within the parent element 
? allows the element to appear 0 or just once within the parent element. The element is optional but if it is included it cannot repeat.


study case

<!ELEMENT course (#PCDATA | name | price |rating)*> : Mixed Content;
This element can occur as many times it wants or 0 times also in any order.


Define attributes for any example element within you a DTD
#REQUIRED - to make it mandatory
#IMPLIED - to make it implied 
#FIXED - to make that value a constant or fixed
